..a.	ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing;
..b	saving expense;
..c	dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate –
..i	to the amount of money involved;
..ii	to the importance of the case;
..iii	to the complexity of the issues; and
..iv to the financial position of each party;
..d	ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously and fairly;
..e	allotting to it an appropriate share of the court’s resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases; and
..f	enforcing compliance with rules, practice directions and orders.
