## Overriding Objective

### 1.1	The Overriding Objective

1.  These Rules are a new procedural code with the overriding objective of enabling the court to deal with cases justly and at proportionate cost.

2.  Dealing with a case justly and at proportionate cost includes, so far as is practicable;
    1.  ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing;
    2.  saving expense;
    3.  dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate –
       a.  to the amount of money involved;
       b.  to the importance of the case;
       c.  to the complexity of the issues; and
       d.  to the financial position of each party;
    4.  ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously and fairly;
    5. allotting to it an appropriate share of the court’s resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other        cases; and
    6.  enforcing compliance with rules, practice directions and orders.
